## moviedb
Did you ever had trouble remembering the name of a movie that you watched? I do.
Did you ever caught a liking for a movie that you started watching mid way but don't know the name of it? And you don't know the lead actors name too. But you do know one supporting case and remember the name of the movie you saw him in. I find this fix often.

So i start by back tracking from there to track the name of the current movie that i am watching.

I aim to make this whole process more seamless than the way imdb does.

## Nemean-web-browser
My version of a web browser

The Nemean lion was a vicious monster in Greek mythology that lived at Nemea. It could not be killed with mortals' weapons because its golden fur was impervious to attack. Its claws were sharper than mortals' swords and could cut through any armor. It needed a Heracles to tame it
